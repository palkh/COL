# Communist Open License

This license is written to reflect the ideals of Revolutionary Communism. It is a copyleft license, which means that derivative works must be distributed under the same license terms. The COL is designed to protect the software from being used for counter-revolutionary purposes.

## Overview

Inspired by the coplyleft licenses like the GPL, the COL strives to protect a new generation of Free and Open Source Software, driven by the Freedom and Equality ideals of Revolutionary Communism, against the dominant caitalist interests trying to use it for counter-revolutionary endeavors.
Our goal is to make a software that would be fair, not only for its users and creators, but also to the world around it. Software that contributes to the achivement of the global proletarian uprising and not to the bourgeois class interests.

## Information for Users

For now, this project is in its early stages, and we are still working on the final version of the license. We are open to suggestions and contributions, so feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
