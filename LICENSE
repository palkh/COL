        PREAMBLE

The COL (Communit Open License) is an open, copyleft, and anti-capitalist license.
It is designed to protect software, or any kind of content covered by similar copyright law.

The nature of the capitalist society we live in (as of today, in 2024), tends to subvert any work to its dominant, bourgeois, ideology.
Copyright, and intellectual property in general is one of its tool :
Licenses on replicable content are the latest form of appropriation by the ruling class of what should be a common asset, and contribute  to the developpement of mankind as a whole.
In the beggining of Open-Source software developpemnt, work produced by the free collaboration of volunteers trying to better the world by writting code was licensed under permissive licenses such as the MIT or the BSD, but soon, the parasitic bourgeois saw (yet another) an opportunity to steal some 'surplus value' from other people's work.
Against this constant menace of expropriation of the work of the people by corporations, or other counter-revolutionary entities, leaders in the Free Sftware Movement created the (very progressive) copyleft licenses such as the GPL2 or GPL3.
Unfortunately, despite the efforts of the brilliant members of the FOSS community, sofware under such licenses can and will be used by the ruling class to try and prevent the people's Revolution from happening, and to maintain the capitalist order of suffering and inequalities.
By contrast, the Communist Open License has the mission to protect OUR software from being used in any way that might go against the interests of the working class, and the revolutionary parties, trying to free it from the chains of Capital.

More clearly, the goal of this license if both to protect the freedom of the developpers and users, in the spirit of the FOSS movement, and to ensure the program will serve the Communists ideals of Equality, Cooperation and Democracy :
 - We envision the FOSS community as a way to acheive some sort of communism though sharing of the Means of Production, following the marxist lead of "From each according to their means to each according to their needs".
 - In a more and more Computerized and Internet-pedendent world, software is one of the most powerful tools for ressources production, strategic operations and Information distribution, and should be put to use by Revolutinaries around the World.

We acknownledge that in a context of intense class war, having legal protections in a system where the entire judicial institution is designed for the interest of the bourgeois capitalit is not particularly useful, and that thus the license might be of little to no use for the comrades fighting with lines of code against the counter-revolution.
Despite this, this work was written as a tools for Revolutinaries, but also as a statement, against thoses who try to use FOSS software for their own capitalist interests.
